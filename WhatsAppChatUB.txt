02/06/23, 10:55 am - +1 (716) 923-5875: Some reasons to stay at collegiate village are: collegiate village is a gated community so its very safe. The apartments are fully furnished and have all the major appliances with in unit washer and dryer. They have their own shuttle that goes to Ub south Ub north and few other places as well as to grocery stores like walmart on weekends. Utilities like wifi, heat, maintenance, shuttle service, gym, swimming pool and a few others are included in the rent. Maintenance is a very crucial factor for winters in buffalo because of snow. They will remove snow from outside of your apartment as soon as it gathers and shuttles run unless UB cancels classes. The maintenance also fixes any issues in the apartment at zero cost, you just need to give them a call.
02/06/23, 10:55 am - +1 (716) 923-5875: By using my reference you will also get a $300 off on your first month’s rent. If you are interested please join the following group or you can DM me directly.

My roommate and I were talking to a landlord and we're pretty sure that person was trying to scam us. So we stopped pursuing that offer.
Now we've started talking to other landlords and we are just super cautious. How did you all verify the authenticity of the landlord before paying the deposit?
30/06/23, 7:23 pm - +91 99710 43198: know about the property and landlord from UB GISA page or any other sources
30/06/23, 7:24 pm - +91 99710 43198: from earlier tenants who have lived there (they must have once posted a sub-lease post)

30/06/23, 9:52 pm - +91 75470 75515: 1.) If you’re speaking with realtors, ask for the landlord’s contact or the contact information of the current tenants.
2.) Find out the information like pictures etc about the house from zillow as well. You can compare the pictures shared by the realtor/owner. 
3.) If anyone ask for any payment upfront without sharing complete details, they are definitely fraud. 
4.) If possible, find someone who can checkout the place on your behalf. 
5.) You can ask people for their owner’s contact via facebook in case they are vacating in July/August

30/06/23, 10:33 pm - +91 77740 47088: As a senior i will suggest please dont fall for any of these scams. We have a lot of people who are in buffalo. Always ask someone to go and visit the house before paying money. 
I see a lot of you are anxious and desperate about finding housing and I absolutely understand it. But be patient and very sure before sending money or finalising anything. 
A lot of these people scammed students last year.
